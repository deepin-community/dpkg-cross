dpkg-cross (2.6.14) unstable; urgency=medium

  The cross architecture configuration files have moved to the
  new cross-config package and the older dpkg-cross binary with
  supporting perl module are now deprecated. Future uploads will
  only include the cross-config package.
  .
  Use cross-config to retain support for autotools and CMake
  cross-building configuration.
  .
  If you use the deprecated dpkg-cross binary, now is the time
  to migrate away from these path changes. The dpkg-cross binary
  and the supporting perl module should NOT be expected to be
  part of Debian by the time of the Stretch release.

dpkg-cross (2.6.2) unstable; urgency=low

  debhelper (>= 8.1.2) now contains support for stripping cross
  built packages without needing binutils-multiarch. Therefore,
  binutils-multiarch is no longer necessary for cross-building
  but there may be situations where it may still be useful.
  .
  Note that binutils-multiarch is set to get larger as part of
  ongoing development within binutils-multiarch itself.

dpkg-cross (2.3.3) unstable; urgency=low

  gccross and buildcross have been removed for easier migration into
  dpkg. gccross was already 'opt-in' via emdebian-tools and not used
  directly within dpkg-cross. This removes the last major block to
  removing dpkg-cross itself and implementing all support within
  dpkg (specifically dpkg-dev).
  .
  The opt-in is implemented via debian/xcontrol by adding a line:
  [X-]Build-Cross-Libtool: yes
  .
  Every package using the opt-in will be declared buggy in 
  buildd.emdebian.org with a view to having a permanent fix in 
  that package before the release of Debian Squeeze. In many cases,
  fixes to replace gccross will need patches to upstream code
  Support will be retained in emdebian-tools to assist with new 
  packages but this is to remain an interim support step that should
  not be relied upon for a package in a stable Emdebian release after
  Emdebian 1.0. i.e. gccross is more legacy code that only exists
  in order to be replaced.

dpkg-cross (1.99+2.0.0pre2) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of dpkg-cross has been extensively refactored and
  includes a new Perl module with a new API.
  .
  The dpkg-buildpackage and dpkg-shlibdeps diversions have been
  removed due to increased cross-building support in dpkg-dev.
  The customised versions of objcopy, objdump and strip have also been
  removed due to the new dependency on binutils-multiarch.
  .
  As dpkg-cross is merged gradually back into dpkg, parts of the
  old dpkg-cross will be removed from the package and simply stored
  in CVS. Maintaining the old versions during the current changes in 
  the Debian::DpkgCross module is impractical and it is unlikely that 
  the CVS versions will be usable with the released package as the 
  old code is increasingly left behind. Functions listed as "Legacy code"
  in the module are likely to be removed in due course.
  .
  The next stage is expected to be the migration of the cross-config.$arch
  files into dpkg-dev along with a method to replicate the gccross 
  script currently used by dpkg-cross.
  .
  The dpkg-cross 'core' functionality of preparing Architecture:all
  packages of development headers and shared objects for use in a cross
  build is expected to be retained outside dpkg until such time as the
  other components are successfully merged and a suitable method is 
  available to implement support for cross-building within dpkg and apt.
  .
  This will then result in both dpkg-cross and apt-cross being removed
  from Debian in preference for the integrated cross building support
  within dpkg and apt.
  .
  The 2.x series of dpkg-cross will therefore aim to achieve its own
  removal.
  .
  Once this happens, dpkg-dev will conflict with and replace dpkg-cross
  to ensure the removal of the old code.

dpkg-cross (1.26) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of dpkg-cross uses new paths to default cross-compile
  environment, to follow changes in debian arch aliases.
  E.g. it uses arm-linux-gnu instead of arm-linux.
  .
  Because of this, -arch-cross packages created by this version
  are not compatable with those created by previous versions. Some
  dependency magic was added to make incompatable combination less
  probable, but there are some situations when it may not help.
  Because of this, it's better to recreate all -arch-cross packages
  using this version of dpkg-cross.
  .
  Also, to actually cross-compile debian packages, new versions of
  cross-toolchain packages are required. Appropriate patches for gcc-4.0
  have been submitted, and should be available since gcc-4.0 4.0.2-6.
  Cross-patches for binutils package, as well as not-yet-included
  cross-patches for gcc packages, are at
    http://zigzag.lvk.cs.msu.su/~nikita/debian/cross-patches
  Binary cross-toolchain i386 debs for different targets are at
    http://zigzag.lvk.cs.msu.su/~nikita/debian/sid/

dpkg-cross (1.24) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of dpkg-cross uses /etc/dpkg-cross and ~/.dpkg-cross instead
  of /etc/dpkg and ~/.dpkg. Dpkg-cross files will be moved from /etc/dpkg
  to /etc/dpkg-cross automatically during upgrade. If you have any dpkg-cross
  files in ~/.dpkg directory, please move those to ~/.dpkg-cross directory
  manually.
