    those to $crossdir/src/. Needed for linux-headers packages.
    Suggested by Marcus Better <marcus@better.se>.
  * Added -nw option to dpkg-buildpackage wrapper, that disables usage 
    of gccross. Closes: #373193. See log of that bug for details.

dpkg-cross (1.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added tzdata to default 'removedeps' (request from NIIBE Yutaka
    <gniibe@fsij.org>); also added gcc-4.1-base to default 'keepdeps'.
  * Set maintainer to Debian Embedded Group <debian-embedded@lists.debian.org>,
    set interested people as uploaders.
  * Set Standards-Version to 3.7.2, no changes needed.
  * Rased DH_COMPAT to 5, rased version in versioned build dependency
    on dephelper to 5.

    - added nm, ar, ranlib, windres to %std_tools,
    - added w32 lines to get_tool tables.

 -- Nikita V. Youshchenko <yoush@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Apr 2006 10:54:37 +0400

dpkg-cross (1.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update default paths and prefixes, to match changes in debian
    toolchain. Mostly by adding '-gnu' here and there.
  * Now dpkg-cross adds additional provides-depends logic to generated
    -$arch-cross packages, to avoid -$arch-cross packages generated
    prior to path changes to satisfy deps of packages generated post
    those changes.
  * Updated list of dpkg-architecture variables to set when
    cross-compiling, to match current dpkg-architecture.
  * dpkg-shlibdeps: addded "elf64-x86-64" and "elf64-powerpc" to
    @crosslib64formats, as GOTO Masanori <gotom@debian.or.jp> requested.
  * Added objdump and objcopy wrappers similar to strip wrapper. Seem to
    be needed by dh_strip calls from gcc-4.0 package builds.
  * Added armeb architecture support (Closes: #336080).
  * Fixed a typo in dpkg-buildpackage (Closes: #334282).
  * Added gcc-*-base to keepdeps in default /etc/dpkg-cross/cross-compile.
  * Removed any reference to unused 'crossinfo' variable.
  * Added cross-config.{arm,armeb}, created by  Lennert Buytenhek
    <buytenh+debian@wantstofly.org>.
  * If dpkg-deb -b fails, show it's output even if not verbose.
  * When merging .changes files, remove 'source' from arch field of the
    merged file name. See #322926 for details.
  * Set Maintainer to my debian.org e-mail.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.2, no changes needed.

dpkg-cross (1.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Create md5sums files for -arch-cross packages.
  * Added /etc/dpkg-cross/cross-compile lines for glibc package as suggested
    by Jorik Jonker <jorik@dnd.utwente.nl>.
  * Included patch for cross-config.m32r from #284439.
  * Set umask earlier when converting packages; this may fix problem (that
    I could not reliably reproduse) with bad permissions of directories
    in converted packages if umask is restrictive.
  * Added patch from Alexandra N. Kossovsky <sasha@oktetlabs.ru> that adds
    amd64 as supported target (Closes: #308945).

 -- Nikita V. Youshchenko <yoush@cs.msu.su>  Thu,  5 May 2005 23:33:41 +0400

dpkg-cross (1.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use /etc/dpkg-cross and ~/.dpkg-cross instead of /etc/dpkg and ~/.dpkg.
  * On upgrade from older versions, move dpkg-cross files from /etc/dpkg/ to
    /etc/dpkg-cross/, on downgrade to older versions do the reverse.
  * Moved gccross from /usr/bin to /usr/share/dpkg-cross, because this script
    is not intended to be implicitly called by user.
  * Added NEWS.Debian, with a note about moving conffiles.

dpkg-cross (1.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Become official maintainer, try 2.
  * Create temporary directories in a safe way.
  * Removed workarounds of ancient dpkg-buildpackage[.orig] bugs (versioned
    dependency on dpkg-dev should ensure recent version of
    dpkg-buildpackage.orig).
  * Always pass -uc to dpkg-buildpackage.orig, and call sign command from
    dpkg-buildpackage wrapper after possible merge of .changes files.
    Closes: #257627.

 -- Nikita V. Youshchenko <yoush@cs.msu.su>  Tue, 11 Jan 2005 00:25:45 +0300

dpkg-cross (1.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Become official maintainer.
  * Add support for DPKGCROSSARCH variable to pass information about
    current target between tools (using ARCH causes problems with packages
    that use it for their own).
  * Changelogs of my 'intermediate releases':

    1.20.6:

    * Add -uc to dpkg-buildpackage.orig call only if existing .changes file
      does not contain information for $arch.

    1.20.5:

    * Instead of unsetting LD_LIBRARY_PATH, just clean it of paths that don't
      start with /usr/lib or /usr/share. This should avoid fakeroot breakage.

    1.20.4:

    * Implemented 'unset' feature for configuration file (Closes: #246061).
    * Unset LD for e2fsprogs in default /etc/dpkg/cross-compile.

    1.20.3:

    * When running external tools which output is parsed, set LC_ALL=C.
      Closes: #283804.
    * Remove usused sub getsoname from dpkg-shlibdeps.

    1.20.2:

    * Unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH in strip and dpkg-shlibdeps.
      It is not needed, and could result into attempts to link non-native
      libraries into tools that are called.
    * In tool detection code, use 'file -L' to dereference symlinks.
    * Handle strip options with parameters in strip wrapper.
    * Don't try to call objdump on non-binaries in dpkg-shlibdeps.
    * Don't set STRIP variable to $(TARGET)-strip, we have strip wrapper now.
    * Remove example setting STRIP in default /etc/dpkg/cross-compile,
      because the example is no longer valid with strip wrapper.
    * Above items fix all 282020 issues. Closes: #282020.
    * Don't set cross names for 'ar' and 'ranlib' because these tools are
      actially architecture-independent, and additional vars break some builds.
      Closes: #283627.

    1.20.1:

    * Applied patch from NIIBE Yutaka <gniibe@fsij.org> that adds support
      for m32r architecture (Closes: 280714).
    * Call dpkg-buildpackage.orig with -uc if .changes file merge is going to
      happen after package build (Closes: 257627).

dpkg-cross (1.20) unstable; urgency=low

  By Nikita V. Youshchenko <yoush@cs.msu.su>:

  * Moved Build-Depends into Build-Depends-Indep, abd cleaned up
    debian/rules a bit.
  * Move dpkg-cross.pl to /usr/share/perl5, and don't install it executable.
  * Mention /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL in debian/copyright.
  * Add lintian override file to stop lintian complains about no manual
    pages for commands that dpkg-cross package diverts.
  * Changed Standards-Version to 3.6.1 (after doing appropriate checks). 

  By Raphael Bossek <bossekr@debian.org>:

  * Typo in detection of recursive gccross calls fixed.
  * Gccross documentation updated.

  By Nikita V. Youshchenko <yoush@cs.msu.su>:

  * When setting up temporary directory with gccross symlinks, link all
    names that look like available compilers for target.

  By Nikita V. Youshchenko <yoush@cs.msu.su>:

  * Changed default crossbase to /usr. In fact, such default has been
    there in default /etc/dpkg/cross-compile for ages, but if that line
    was not used (e.g. because of use of user configuration file),
    crossbase happened to change to /usr/local. That is not consistent
    with cross-toolchain, so should be fixed.

dpkg-cross (1.19) unstable; urgency=low

  Changes by Nikita Youshchenko <yoush@cs.msu.su>

  * An improved version of gccross is now used by default when
    cross-compiling debian packages.
  * Fixed cross-tool autodetection for m68k and s390x architecturs.

 -- David Schleef <ds@schleef.org>  Wed, 06 Oct 2004 14:05:32 -0700

dpkg-cross (1.18) unstable; urgency=low

  Changes by Nikita Youshchenko <yoush@cs.msu.su>

  * Added strip wrapper that tries to detect architectures of given
    binaries and call appropriate strip programs.
    Modified dpkg-buildpackage wrapper to add strip wrapper to PATH.
    Removed dh_strip wrapper and diversion of dh_strip (Closes: #265620).
  * Stop adding /usr/local/bin to path - user who needs it probably
    already has it.
  * Removed ancient dpkg-cross-convert - it is already 5 years old,
    and is probably not compatable with current dpkg-cross.
  * Note at the top of README.Debian that information there is outdated.
  * Fix a typo in dpkg-cross script that caused '-aarm' not work.
  * Depend on 'binutils' and on 'file' because scripts use programs provided
    by those packages.

  Changes by Raphael Bossek <bossekr@debian.org>

  * Added gccross as wrapper for cross-compilers.
  * Fixed proceeding of /usr/(src|lib) directories with dpkg-cross.

dpkg-cross (1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  Changes done by Nikita Youshchenko <yoush@cs.msu.su>
  
  * Divert dh_strip with a version that tries to use strip binary appropriate
    for cross-compiling. This in fact was in 1.16, but I forgot to add this to
    changelog.
  * Removed missed debugging code that caused dpkg-cross to print "FAIL" and
    exit if target-cpp is available. Closes: #259516.
  * Fixed a typo in dpkg-cross.pl that caused variable values to be lost.
  * Implemented support for lib64. Closes: #245835.

dpkg-cross (1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  Changes were all done by Nikita V. Youshchenko <yoush@cs.msu.su>.
  Version numbers and changelog entries correspond to the packages
  hosted at his site, which is now completely merged.

  * dpkg-cross.in: create /usr/share/doc/XXX directory in converted packages,
    and put a readme file there.
    - now each converted package always has an unique file, so situation
      described in #231511 is cleanly impossible. Closes: #231511.
  * dpkg-cross.in: accept -A|--convert-anyway option, that will make
    dpkg-cross to convert package even it does not provide any files useful for
    cross-compilation.
  * dpkg-cross.1: document -A option.
  * dpkg-shlibdeps.in: honour SHLIBSLOCALFILE and SUBSTVARSFILE environment
    variables as default locations for shlibs.local and substvars files. 

  1.14.7

  * dpkg-cross.in: rewrite dpkg-cross -b procedure, using different logic.
    Now it first completely unpacks source deb, and only then decides what
    files to move or modify.
    Now it should not loose asm/arch symlink when processing
    linux-kernel-headers.

  1.14.6

  * debian/rules: move commands from binary-arch to binary-indep (everything
    built is architecture-independent)
  * debian/rules: don't run dh_strip and dh_shlibdeps - both are useless for
    this package
  * Implemented enhanced addition variable setting control, after some
    discussion with EmDebian people. See cross-compile(5) for more
    information. Note that the new format of this file is completely
    backward-compatable.
    Example of usage for EmDebian added as a comment to the default
    /etc/dpkg/cross-compile file.
  * Removed zlib1g-arm-cross.deb that was forgotten in the build directory
    of 1.14.5 version.

  1.14.5

  * dpkg-shlibdeps.in: fix shlibs.local handling. Now it doesn't try to use
    dpkg --search to find a library from the package being built.
    Closes: #221646.
  * dpkg-cross.in: fail with appropriate message on attempt to convert
    already-converted package. 

  1.14.4

  * dpkg-buildpackage.in: set PATH in environment, not in MAKEFLAGS.
    Closes: #139182.
  * dpkg-buildpackage.in: when merging changes file, merge also Binary:
    and Description: fields, to handle the case when different sets of binary
    packages are built for different architectures. Closes: #221285.

  1.14.3

  * dpkg-cross.in: try to use fakeroot when building a package as user,
    issue a warning if fakeroot is not available. Closes: #221993.
  * debian/control: suggest fakeroot.
  * dpkg-buildpackage.in: don't ignore -uc. Closes: #217547.

  1.14.2

  * Fix dpkg-shlibdeps wrapper to handle shlibs with 'libxxx-vvv.so' sonames
    (needed e.g. for libdb4.2)

  1.14.1

  * Added /etc/dpkg/cross-compile options to handle non-library dependences
    better (Closes: #228616).
    Changed the patch a bit to remove complete dependency if one of
    alternatives is removed.
    Example: libssl depends on debconf | debconf-2.0; debconf is obviously not
    needed for cross-compile environment setup, so debconf is in removedeps,
    and other alternatives for the dependency will be discarded.
  * Detect .so files that are ldscripts, and fix paths there (Closes: #229241).
  * Supress error message from find when there are no pkgconfig files in the
    package.
  * Keep symlinks in pkgconfig directory
  * Don't print tons of junk when moving header files
  * Allow Architecture: all packages to be converted. There is a rationale to
    convert them sometimes (e.g. x-dev package that contains only headers)
  * Don't fail if resulting package contains headers only
    - dpkg-cross is now capable to process linux-kernel-headers
      (Closes: #230595, #222168)
  * Remove unused files and directories from source package. This makes
    package almost 10 times smaller :).
  * Really print error message if source file for dpkg-cross -b can't be
    opened.

 -- David Schleef <ds@schleef.org>  Fri, 11 Jun 2004 10:07:40 -0700

dpkg-cross (1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Taking over package.  Never got a response from Roman (Closes: #211013)

 -- David Schleef <ds@schleef.org>  Wed, 01 Oct 2003 13:58:19 -0700

dpkg-cross (1.13.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * I'm intending to take over the package, as I haven't heard from
    the maintainer in over 6 weeks.
  * Add code to mangle pkgconfig files
  * debian/control: Add debhelper to build-depends
  * Add cross-config.${arch} files for a number of architectures
    (Closes: #127723)
  * Handle libtool .la files (Closes: #160687)
  * dpkg-cross.in: set umask, since 077 causes failures in dpkg-deb
    (Closes: #126321)
  * Change /usr/doc/ to /usr/share/doc (Closes: #79746)
  * dpkg-shlibdeps.in: Disabled arch check that fails on mips
    (Closes: #86808)

dpkg-cross (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed maintainer email address.
  * dpkg-cross.in: Set LC_ALL=C when calling tar, as we parse the error
    messages and expect them to be in English.

 -- Roman Hodek <roman@hodek.net>  Tue,  5 Sep 2000 17:31:00 +0200

dpkg-cross (1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-cross: Added debianutils to @omit_depends, so that current libc6
    can be converted and doesn't depend on a spurious
    debianutils-m68k-cross.

 -- Roman Hodek <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>  Thu, 2 Mar 2000 10:24:37 +0100

dpkg-cross (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

dpkg-cross (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-buildpackage: Another retval change...: If dpkg-buildpackage
    caught a signal, return signal value + 128.
  * dpkg-cross: when extracting dirs, from the input .deb's data.tar.gz,
    also use names starting with "./" (newer tar versions name files like
    this.) Closes: #48006
  * dpkg-buildpackage wrapper: now supports signing-related options like
    current dpkg-buildpackage (-spgp, -sgpg, -k, -m). I.e., it also uses
    gpg if dpkg-buildpackage would.
  * FHS transition (Standards-Version 3.0.1)

dpkg-cross (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * New method for passing cross variables to Makefiles. They're not put
    into the environment anymore and MAKEFLAGS=-e is used to make read
    them. Instead, the variable definitions are appended to MAKEFLAGS
    itself. (The same mechanism is used my make to pass command line
    overrides to sub-makes.)
    The advantage is that MAKEFLAGS and thus the definitions are still
    under the control of make. The definitions can be changed if a
    Makefile calls make with more/different definitions on the command
    line. Also, there are no side effects anymore by other environment
    variables not under the control of dpkg-cross (e.g. the MANPATH
    problem, a CFLAGS exported by top-level Makefile overriding CFLAGS in
    sub-Makefiles).
  * cross-config.gnu: new file for GNU/Hurd OS.
  * cross-config.common: new file for stuff common to Linux and Hurd.
  * cross-config.common: now sets $host to avoid that configure runs
    config.guess, which fails if $CC is a cross compiler.
  * cross-config.{i386,m68k}: some more sizeof definitions.
  * cross-config.*, cross-compile.example: Add notice that personal
    additions should be mailed to me so that I can include them in future
    releases.
  * dpkg-cross: when building a cross package, don't omit symlinks that
    point to a directory.
  * dpkg-buildpackage: The wrapper now preserves the exit status of the
    original dpkg-buildpackage. Closes: #41259

dpkg-cross (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-buildpackage: Don't Read debian/changelog if only option is -h.
    closes: #37369.
  * Changed perl dependency to perl5|perl.
  * The dpkg-buildpackage now also sets the new environment variables
    DEB_HOST_{ARCH,GNU_CPU,GNU_OS,GNU_TYPE}.
  * Updated copyright file for new location /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL.
  * Updated Standards-Version to 3.0.0.

dpkg-cross (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-shlibdeps: Fix error message when lib not found (was wrong path
    if $CROSSROOT set.) (Fixes: #36679)
  * dpkg-buildpackage: Call original dpkg-buildpackage via shell command
    "." instead of "source", because ash doesn't understand the latter.
    (Fixes: #36887)
  * dpkg-cross: When installing (or just converting) packages, have a
    special look at libc.so, which is no real lib but a linker script. It
    contains absolute paths, which need to be rewritten.
  * Updated Standards-Version to 2.5.0.0 (no changes).

dpkg-cross (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some changes to make dpkg-cross work for Hurd: There, cross compiling
    is usually done with a Hurd installation on the same disk (in another
    partition).
     * New config variable set -$(ARCH)= sets path of cross
       installation for a specific architecture.
     * In dpkg-shlibdeps, strip $crossroot (if set) from lib names, and
       look in the cross installation under $crossroot for files
       (shlibs.default, *.shlibs files, etc.)
     * In dpkg-buildpackage, set binutils env vars (LD, AR, ...) only if
       target CPU is different.
    Thanks to Santiago Vila <sanvila@unex.es> for ideas and help in
    testing this.
  * Added Suggests: binutils-multiarch, since those are available as a
    Debian package now and are needed for many applications of dpkg-cross.
  * Add CXX to list of environment variables to change.
  * In the Makefile added dependencies of all scripts on confinit and
    confsub.

dpkg-cross (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Also omit cpp in dependencies of cross packages.
  * New variable default_arch in /etc/dpkg/cross-compile. This can be used
    to avoid the -a option to dpkg-cross, if there is only one or one
    mainly used cross installation.

dpkg-cross (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove #!/bin/sh from /etc/dpkg/cross-config.*, since Lintian
    complained about it.
  * Switch from debstd to debhelper.

dpkg-cross (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major reorganization of package installation (dpkg-cross), based on
    great idea by Joey Hess. (Fixes: #15725) dpkg-cross doesn't implement
    its own package management anymore, but uses dpkg for this. Therefore
    it converts to-be-installed packaged to *-arch-cross packages by
    moving files around and rewriting control infos.
  * New tool dpkg-cross-convert to convert old-style installations to new
    dpkg-based ones.
  * Little rewrites to dpkg-shlibdeps due to new installation scheme (now
    uses dpkg --search instead of own function, new location of shlibs
    files)
  * New options -v and -q to dpkg-cross (verbose/quiet)
  * New actions --update and --query for dpkg-cross: They update all
    installed packages if updates are available, or list those updates,
    resp.
  * Standards-Version: updated to 2.4.0.0

dpkg-cross (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * In the dpkg-buildpackage wrapper, put $crossbin first into $PATH, so
    that cross compiling binaries can take precedence over native ones.
    (fixes: Bug #15726)

 -- Roman Hodek <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>  Wed, 10 Dec 1997 11:37:57 +0100

dpkg-cross (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make maintainer=CURRENTUSER work (the change for it was lost somehow)
    (fixes: Bug#15715)
  * Check for no options at all to dpkg-cross (fixes: Bug#15712)
  * Do not remove kernel headers (include/{linux,asm,scsi}) if those dirs
    are symlinks, i.e. if the user has removed the files coming with
    libc-dev and replaced them by symlinks into a current source.
    (Otherwise dpkg-cross would remove the files in the kernel source!)
  * Reject libc5 compability packages (cannot be handled (yet) by
    dpkg-cross).
  * Ignore the /usr/include/X11 symlink (provokes a tar error if xlib*-dev
    already installed).
  * Fix some typos and minor mistakes.

dpkg-cross (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug in dpkg-cross that made it blind for packages with a '.' in
    their name...
  * dpkg-cross -h now the same as dpkg-cross --help.
  * New option -l/--list to dpkg-cross, with similar functionality to dpkg
    -l (short listing of packages installed matching a pattern)
  * dpkg-cross option --list renamed to --listfiles for consistency with
    dpkg

 -- Roman Hodek <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>  Mon, 3 Nov 1997 15:22:34 +0100

dpkg-cross (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * On dpkg-cross -i, also ignore tar messages like "error exit delayed".
  * Fix typo ($dpkg_errs instead $tar_errs) in dpkg-cross.in
  * In dpkg-shlibdeps, change objdump call and method how to find needed
    libraries; the objdump in binutils-2.8 doesn't have the -k option (raw
    section contents) anymore, so use --private-headers instead and look
    for ELF NEEDED entries in the dynamic section. Also changed
    debian/README to reflect this change.
  * Add special handling for -m option (see README), to work around a bug
    in dpkg-buildpackage 1.4.0.17

dpkg-cross (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes for packages using imake:
  * IMAKECPP is defined in the environment to $(ARCH)-linux-cpp, to pass
    correct architecture (via standard defines) to the imake templates.
  * USRLIBDIR is defined to $(CROSSLIB), otherwise libraries are not
    found or dependencies to them are wrong.
  * MANPATH is explicitly removed from the environment, because the same
    name is used in imake-generated Makefiles, and since we use make -e,
    the user's setting would override the standard definition, causing
    havoc when installing man pages :-)
  * Fixes for packages using GNU autoconf:
  * CONFIG_SITE is set to /etc/dpkg/cross-config.linux, which in turn
    includes an target-arch specific file. There, several values for
    configure are defined that cannot be determined in an cross compiling
    environment.
